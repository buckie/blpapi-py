# event.py

"""A module which defines events related operations.

This file defines an 'Event'. One or more 'Event's are generated as a result of
a subscription or a request. 'Event's contain 'Message' objects which can be
accessed using a 'MessageIterator'. This file also defines a 'EventQueue' for
handling replies synchronously.

Usage
-----
The following code snippet shows how a 'EventQueue' is used with a
'generateToken' request. For any established session 'session' pass an
'EventQueue' object 'tokenEventQueue' when calling 'generateToken'. All
'Event's in responses to 'generateToken' request will be returned in
'tokenEventQueue'.

    tokenEventQueue = EventQueue()
    session.generateToken(eventQueue=tokenEventQueue)

Synchronously read the response 'event' and parse over messages using 'token'

    ev = tokenEventStatus.nextEvent()
    token = None
    if ev.eventType() == blpapi.Event.TOKEN_STATUS:
        for msg in ev:
           if msg.messageType() == TOKEN_SUCCESS:
               token = msg.getElementAsString(TOKEN)
           elif msg.messageType() == TOKEN_FAILURE:
               break
    if not token:
        raise Exception("Failed to get token")
