class Name(object):
    """Name represents a string in a form which is efficient for comparison.

    Name(nameString) constructs a Name object.

    Name objects are used to identify and access the classes which define the
    schema - SchemaTypeDefinition, SchemaElementDefinition, SchemaConstant,
    SchemaConstantList. They are also used to access the values in Element
    objects and Message objects.

    The Name class is an efficient substitute for a string when used as a key,
    providing constant time comparison and ordering operations. Two Name
    objects constructed from equal strings will always compare equally.

    Where possible Name objects should be initialized once and then reused.
    Creating a Name object involves a search in a container requiring multiple
    string comparison operations.

    Note: Each Name instance refers to an entry in a global static table. Name
    instances for identical strings will refer to the same data. There is no
    provision for removing entries from the static table so Name objects should
    only be used when the set of input strings is bounded.

    For example, creating a Name for every possible field name and type in a
    data model is reasonable (in fact, the API will do this whenever it
    receives schema information). However converting sequence numbers on
    incoming messages to strings and creating a Name from each one of those
    strings will cause the static table to grow in an unbounded manner.
