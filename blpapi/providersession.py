        If 'eventDispatcher' is None then the Session will create a default
        EventDispatcher for this Session which will use a single thread for
        dispatching events. For more control over event dispatching a specific
        instance of EventDispatcher can be supplied. This can be used to share
        a single EventDispatcher amongst multiple Session objects.

        If an 'eventDispatcher' is supplied which uses more than one thread the
        Session will ensure that events which should be ordered are passed to
        callbacks in a correct order. For example, partial response to
        a request or updates to a single subscription.
